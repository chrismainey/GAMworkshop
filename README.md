<!-- badges: start -->

This is a repository for my workshop on GAMs for NHS-R community
conference 2023.

This course uses Simon Wood’s `mgcv` R package:
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/index.html>

The teaching material draws heavily from Noam Ross’ introduction to GAMs
in R course, and you can find the course and the GitHub repository on
the following links:

<https://noamross.github.io/gams-in-r-course/>

<https://github.com/noamross/gams-in-r-course>

They are really good, and you’ll find out more about GAMs using them
than my workshop will cover.
